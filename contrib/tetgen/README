Fixed tetgen.C so that no warnings are issued under debug mode in libMesh.
This allows us to use the libMesh CXXFLAGS for compilation, which is important
for proper shared library generation.

The TetGen user's manual in files manual.pdf has been removed from this
directory. Also, the .cxx files were renamed to .C. The original makefile
was renamed to makefile.orig. The manual may be found on the TetGen homepage

TetGen
A Quality Tetrahedral Mesh Generator and 3D Delaunay Triangulator
Version 1.3 (Released on June 13, 2004).

TetGen generates exact Delaunay tetrahedralizations, exact constrained
Delaunay tetrahedralizations, and quality tetrahedral meshes. The
latter are quality conforming Delaunay and nicely graded if no input
angle is smaller than 60 degree.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The distributed version of TetGen includes the following files:

  README               This file.
  LICENSE              Copyright notices.
  tetgen.h             Header file of the TetGen library.
  tetgen.cxx           C++ source code of the TetGen library.
  predicates.cxx       C++ source code of the geometric predicates.
  makefile             Makefile for compiling TetGen.
  manual.pdf           User's manual.
  example.poly         A sample data file.

TetGen should run on all 32-bit and 64-bit computers.  Use an ANSI C++
compiler to compile the program.  

The easiest way to compile it is to edit and use the included
makefile.  Before compiling, read the makefile, which describes the
options, and edit it accordingly.  You should specify:

  - the C++ compiler, and
  - the level of optimization.

Once you've done this, type "make" to compile the program.

After compiling, type "tetgen -h" for a brief introduction into
TetGen.  The included user's manual contains documentation and
examples. Alternatively, the online manual includes a comprehensive
documentation for using TetGen and more examples, please see:

            http://tetgen.berlios.de/index.html

The development of TetGen is supported by the pdelib project of
Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics.  Pdelib is
a collection of software components for solving non-linear partial
differential equations including 2D and 3D mesh generators, sparse
matrix solvers, and scientific visualization tools, etc. For further
