1.) Changed #include "laspack/*" to #include "*"
2.) Moved vector.{c,h} to qvector.{c,h} to work with C++.
3.) Renamed Vector QVector.
4.) Added extern "C" to all header files

5.) extended parts of the library to complex support:
    ATTENTION: the complex part is not at all well tested!
    - the real part should have remained the same
    - added several typedefs and preprocessor definitions
    - explicitly fixed the vector norms for complex arithmetic
      to match with PETSc definition
6.) for better complex support, added laspack_config.h which
    defines some preprocessor macros

7.) Fixed GMRES for complex numbers:
    - added a function InnerProd_VV(QVector *V1, QVector *V2)
      that computes the inner product of two vectors. For
      real valued vectors this is simply Mul_VV,
      for complex vectors the adjoint of V1 has to be taken.
