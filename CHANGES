0.6.4 -> 0.7.0
  * Certified Reduced Basis model creation/evaluation
  * Adjoint-based sensitivity calculations and error indicators
  * Support for newer PETSc, SLEPc
  * More autodetection of optional dependencies
  * New examples:
  ** Discontinuous Galerkin
  ** SCALAR Lagrange multipliers
  ** Certified Reduced Basis method
  * Parallel:: utilities for std::set data
  * Parallel:: support for non-default MPI communicators
  * Parallel:: support for non-magic-number message tags
  * GMVIO support for subdomain material ids
  * ExodusII support for writing discontinuous data
  * Switched some example output formats to Exodus, now that GMV is going away
  * More ASCII IO support for variable precision
  * FEMContext utilities are now useable outside FEMSystem
  * Optional BLAS-based dense linear algebra operations
  * Improved fork of GetPot input parsing
  * Support for interior boundary ids
  * Elem::find_edge_neighbors utility
  * Additional patch recovery error estimation norm options
  * Additional SystemNorm functionality
  * Support for zero-dimensional "meshes"
  * Support mesh construction without pre-specified dimensionality
  * Optional independent redirection of libMesh output/error text streams
  * Moved libMesh classes into libMesh namespace
  * More forward declarations, refactoring to reduce header dependencies
  * Fix for an infrequent-but-major I/O-corrupting bug in our libHilbert interface
  * Fix for errors when doing adaptive refinement across a periodic boundary
  * Fix for projections on systems with per-subdomain variables
  * Many fixes for minor bugs, overzealous assertions
